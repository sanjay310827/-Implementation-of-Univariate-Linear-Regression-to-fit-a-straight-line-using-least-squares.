# AIM:
To implement univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line using least squares.

# Equipments Required:
 1. Hardware – PCs
 2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook
  
# Algorithm
 1. Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
 2. Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
 3. Find the slope m of the line of best fit using the formula:

 4. Compute the y -intercept of the line by using the formula:

 5. Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line. 6. Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.
